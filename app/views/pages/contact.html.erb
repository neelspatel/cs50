      	On turftalk, users can create or join a "turf" that is distinguished by its location (i.e. a building or classroom). Anyone within the geographical region can join the "turf," and, once inside, users can chat, and share, comment on, and rate links with the people around them. Turftalk will hopefully prove to be fun, intuitive, and useful way to bring people who are physically close to each other together on a more social and personal level.

        In the past decade, we've seen an explosion of social networking that strives to connect those that are not in the same location. However, the value of connecting to those immediately around you as a means of sharing ideas and starting conversations between strangers, acquaintances, and friends cannot and should not be overlooked. For this reason, we created turftalk, a unique hyper local social media site. Again, turftalk will hopefully prove to be fun, intuitive, and useful way to bring people who are physically close to each other together on a more personal and social level.
